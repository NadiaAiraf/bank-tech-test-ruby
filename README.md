# bank tech test Ruby

Makers Tech Test Week 10.

This is the first tech test of the week. The aim is to produce the best code you can on the kind of tests that potential employers might give you.

This first test is to mimic some interactions of a bank account, specifically depositing money, withdrawing money and printing a bank statement showing all historical transactions. My approach to the problem can be found lower down.
